If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl) to locate official and current sources online.

Do not introduce new technologies unless explicitly instructed and justified.
You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user
