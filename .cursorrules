File Structure:
See the file tree for the project: @docs/project_file_tree.md

Key organizational principles for files and folders:
- Route components in app/
- Reusable components in components/
- Reusable business logic in lib/
- Shared types in types/
- Database logic outside src/
- Configuration files at root level
- Storybook stories in src/stories
- Route groups in parentheses for organization (e.g., (auth), (dashboard), (root))


IMPORTANT:
- After all changes are made, ALWAYS build the project with `npm run build`. Ignore warnings, fix errors.
- Always add a one-sentence summary of changes and a time stamp in human readable format to `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format at the end of every agent interaction.
- If you forget, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update `.cursor-updates`.
- Finally, update git with `git add . && git commit -m "..."`. Don't push.
